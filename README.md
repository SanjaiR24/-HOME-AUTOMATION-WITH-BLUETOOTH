# HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: SANJAI R

*INTERN ID*: CT04DH8046

*DOMAIN*: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*TASK DESCRIPTION*
  
This task focuses on designing a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system using an Arduino UNO, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and a relay module to control a 12V LED.
The system uses a mobile app to wirelessly send commands to the Arduino via Bluetooth. The Arduino receives these commands and toggles the relay accordingly. The relay acts as an electronic switch to turn the connected LED (or any appliance) ON and OFF. The HC-05 Bluetooth module handles wireless communication, while the relay ensures safe control of external devices.
This task demonstrates basic wireless control, digital output switching, and real-time device interaction using Bluetooth and Arduino.

*COMPONENTS USED*:
   
  Arduino UNO

  HC-05 Bluetooth Module

  Relay Module (1 Channel)

  12V LED Module

  12V DC Power Adapter or Battery

  Jumper Wires

  Breadboard

  Android Phone (with Bluetooth Controller App)

*WORKING PRINCIPLE*:

The user pairs the HC-05 module with a mobile phone and sends predefined commands using a Bluetooth Controller app. The Arduino receives these commands via hardware serial and switches the relay ON or OFF.
The relay in turn controls the 12V LED, simulating a basic home appliance. The LED turns ON or OFF based on received commands:

'A' = Turn ON

'B' = Turn OFF

This demonstrates the concept of wireless device control using Arduino and Bluetooth communication.
